<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>Colors provide a valuable visual cue to recognize text. Recognition of colors works much faster than recognition of text. Together with the length and overall shape of a piece of text (such as a nickname),  a color provides a decent amount of entropy to distinguish a reasonable amount of entities.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>The color generation mechanism should provide the following features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consistent generation of color across all platforms depending solely on the identifier used as input for the algorithm.</li>
    <li>The system should be reasonably fast; it must be possible to, for example, apply it to all roster entries even of very large rosters in reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li>It must be able to provide decent contrast on any background.</li>
    <li>The implementation should be stateless and not be complex.</li>
    <li>A fallback path for users with common types of &cvds; must be provided.</li>
    <li>A fallback path for systems which can only use colors from a restricted palette must be provided.</li>
  </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <section2 topic='Generating a color' anchor='usecase-textcolor'>
    <p>To generate a color from a string of text, the follownig algorithms are applied in order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><link url='#algorithm-angle'>Generate an angle in the CbCr plane from the text</link>.</li>
      <li>If enabled, <link url='#algorithm-cvd'>apply configured corrections for &cvds;</link>.</li>
      <li><link url='#algorithm-cbcr'>Convert the angle to a CbCr pair</link>.</li>
      <li>If the output device only supports a small palette of colors, <link url='#algorithm-mappalette'>map the CbCr value to the closest palette color</link>.</li>
      <li>If the output device supports RGB output, <link url='#algorithm-rgb'>convert the CbCr pair to an RGB triple</link>.</li>
    </ol>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Adding colors to participants of a conversation' anchor='usecase-nickcolor'>
    <p>Implementations may colorize the participants of a conversation with an individual color to make them easier to distinguish.</p>
    <p>In such cases, the color SHOULD be generated as described in the <link url='#usecase-textcolor'>Generating a color</link> section. The input used SHOULD be, in descending order of preference, (a) the name assigned in the roster, (b) the nickname from the conversation, (c) the bare JID.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Auto-Generating Avatars' anchor='usecase-avatar'>
    <p>Implementations may want to show a picture in connection with a contact even if the contact does not have an avatar defined (e.g. via &xep0084;).</p>
    <p>In such cases, auto-generating an avatar SHOULD happen as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Obtain a name for the contact, in descending order of preference, (a) from the roster, (b) by using the nickname from the conversation, (c) by using the bare JID.</li>
      <li>Generate a color as described in the <link url='#usecase-textcolor'>Generating a color</link> section.</li>
      <li>Fill an implementation-defined background shape with that color.</li>
      <li>Render the first character of the name in white or black centered on the square.</li>
    </ol>
  </section2>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='rules'>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementations MUST allow the user to turn off any colorization completely.</li>
    <li>Implementations MUST implement the &cvd; profiles and MUST allow the user to choose any of these profiles or to disable the correction.</li>
    <li>Implementations MUST NOT share the &cvd; correction settings with other entities.</li>
  </ul>

  <section2 topic='Angle generation' anchor='algorithm-angle'>
    <p>Input: An identifier, encoded as octets of UTF-8 (&rfc3269;).</p>
    <p>Output: Angle in the CbCr plane.</p>
    <p>Note: The goal of this algorithm is to convert arbitrary text into a scalar value which can then be used to calculate a color. As it happens, the CbCr plane of the YCbCr space determines the color (while Y merely defines the lightness); thus, an angle in the CbCr plane serves as a good scalar value to select a color.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Run the input through CRC32 as defined by zlib (TODO: add citation).</li>
      <li>Take the lower 16 bits and XOR them with the upper 16 bits.</li>
      <li>Divide the value by 65535 (use float division) and multiply it by 2&#960; (two Pi).</li>
    </ol>

  <section2 topic='Corrections for &cvds;' anchor='algorithm-cvd'>
    <p>Input: Angle in the CbCr plane.</p>
    <p>Output: Angle in the CbCr plane.</p>
    <p>Note: This algorithm will re-map the angle to map it away from ranges which can not be distinguished by people with the respective &cvds;.</p>

    <p>Form a vector from the angle and project it to edges of a quad in 2D space with edge length 1 around (0, 0). The resulting coordinates are Cb and Cr:</p>

  <section2 topic='CbCr to RGB' anchor='algorithm-rgb'>
    <p>Input: Values for Cb and Cr in the YCbCr BT.601 color space in the range from -0.5 to 0.5; Value for Y.</p>
    <p>Output: Values for Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B) in the RGB color space in the range from 0 to 1.</p>

      <li>Calculate r, g and b according to BT.601:<code><![CDATA[float r = 2*(1 - KR)*cr + y;
float b = 2*(1 - KB)*cb + y;
float g = (y - KR*r - KB*b)/KG;

  <section2 topic='Adapting the Color for specific Background Colors' anchor='algorithm-bg'>
    <p>Input: RGB values for the color to adapt (Ri, Gi, Bi) and for the background color to adapt to (Rb, Gb, Bb), in the range from 0 to 1 each.</p>

        <code><![CDATA[
rb = 1-rb;
gb = 1-gb;
bb = 1-bb;]]></code></li>
      <li>Mix the inverted background with the color to adapt, using a mixing factor of 0.2:

  <section2 topic='Conversion of an RGB color palette to a CbCr color palette' anchor='algorithm-genpalette'>
    <p>Input: A set of RGB colors (each component from 0 to 1).</p>
    <p>Output: A mapping from CbCr pairs (each component from -0.5 to 0.5) to RGB colors.</p>
    <p>Note: when the algorithm finishes, the mapping maps CbCr values (rounded to two decimal places) to the R, G, B triples which come closest to the desired color and lightness.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create an empty mapping M which maps from pairs of CbCr values to quadruples of Y, R, G and B.</li>

    <p>Output: A palette color as Cbr and Crr values.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>For each color as pair Cbp, Crp in the palette, calculate the distance metric: <code>D = sqrt((Cbp-Cb)*(Cbp-Cb) + (Crp-Cr)*(Crp-Cr))</code>.</li>
      <li>Pick the palette color Cbp, Crp with the smallest distance metric D as result color Cbr, Crr.</li>

<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <section2 topic='Gamma Correction' anchor='impl-gamma'>
    <p>An implementation may choose a different value for Y depending on whether the sink for the R, G and B values expects Gamma Encoded or Gamma Decoded values. The recommended default of 0.732 is 0.5 to the power of 0.45, that is, a Gamma Encoded 0.5.</p>
    <p>Modifications to Y SHOULD NOT be used to correct for bright/dark backgrounds. Implementations SHOULD instead use the algorithm described in <link url='#algorithm-bg'>Adapting the Color for specific Background Colors</link> for that.</p>
  </section2>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Accessibility Considerations' anchor='access'>
  <p>As outlined above, implementations MUST offer the &rgblind; and &bblind; corrections as defined in the <link url='#algorithm-cvd'>Corrections for &cvds;</link> section. Users MUST be allowed to choose between:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>disabling all corrections (skip the Corrections for &cvds; step entirely),</li>
    <li>applying one of the &cvd; correction profiles and</li>
    <li>disabling colorization altogether.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The last option is important for users with monochromatic view.</p>
  <p>Some sources on the internet indicate that people with &cvds; may profit from having larger areas of color to be able to recognize them. This should be taken into consideration when selecting font weights and line widths for colored parts.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>This specification extracts a bit more information from an entity and shows it alongside the existing information to the user. As the algorithm is likely to produce different colors for look-alikes (see &xep0165; for examples) in JIDs, it may add additional protection against attacks based on those.</p>
  <p>Due to the limited set of distinguishable colors, possible &cvds; and/or use of palettes, entities MUST NOT rely on colors being unique in any context.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Design Considerations' anchor='design'>
  <p>This section provides an overview of design considerations made while writing this specification. It shows alternatives which have been considered, and eventually rejected.</p>
  <section2 topic='Other variants of the YCbCr color space' anchor='design-other-ycbcr'>
    <p>The other common YCbCr variants, BT.709 and BT.2020, do not achieve a brightness across the color space as uniform as BT.601 does. Adapting the Y value for uniform luminosity across the range for CbCr would have complicated the algorithm with little or no gain.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Hue-Saturation-Value/Lightness color space' anchor='design-hsv'>
    <p>The HSV and HSL color spaces fail to provide uniform luminosity with fixed value/lightness and saturation parameters. Adapting those parameters for uniform luminosity across the hue range would have complicated the algorithm with litte to no gain.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Palette-based and context-aware coloring' anchor='design-context'>
    <p>Given a fixed-size and finite palette of colors, it would be possible to ensure that, until the number of entities to color exceeds the number of colors, no color collisions happen.</p>
    <p>There are issues with this approach when the set of entities is dynamic. In such cases, it is possible that an entity changes its associated color (for example by re-joining a colored group chat), which defeats the original purpose.</p>
    <p>In addition, more state needs to be taken into account, increasing the complexity of choosing a color.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Choice of mixing function in angle generation' anchor='design-mixing'>
    <p>This specification needs to collapse an arbitrarily long string into just a few bits (the angle in the CbCr plane). To do so, a CRC32 sum is used.</p>
    <p>An alternative, which may yield better distribution of colors, would have been to use a cryptographic hash function. However, the performance and implementation cost for a cryptographic hash function is considerable compared with a simple CRC32, especially on small (less than 1 kiB) inputs.</p>
